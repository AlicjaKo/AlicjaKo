# 👋 Hi, I’m Alicja Kosak

I study software engineering at TAMK in Tampere. I’m interested in AI, cloud engineering, and a bit of everything so I can get the full picture of modern technologies. I believe it is important to stay curious and understand in what direction the world is going. AI is a cutting-edge technology, and it might be scary for people who don’t have any knowledge about it, but it offers limitless possibilities.
